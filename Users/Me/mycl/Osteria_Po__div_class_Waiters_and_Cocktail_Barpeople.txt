Hiring Manager
Osteria Polpo

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Waiter position at Osteria Polpo, as advertised on Seek. Having read about Osteria Polpo's emphasis on Northern Italian cuisine and Venetian cicchetti, coupled with its picturesque location on East Terrace, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

My previous experience in hospitality roles, including waitstaff duties, has equipped me with the skills necessary to thrive in a fast-paced restaurant environment. I am proficient in serving guests, taking orders, answering menu questions, and ensuring a positive dining experience. I am also adept at setting up and clearing tables, and maintaining a clean and organized workspace. In a past role I assisted in food preparation, such as plating dishes, which allowed me to develop skills that might be relevant to the role.

I am a self-motivated and passionate individual with a strong work ethic, and I am eager to learn and grow within the industry. I am particularly drawn to Osteria Polpo's plans for continued growth in 2025 and am confident that I can contribute to your success. I am available to work weeknights, particularly Friday and Saturday nights, as well as Sunday brunch, and am flexible with my hours. Furthermore, I hold a current Responsible Service of Alcohol (RSA) certificate and a Do Food Safely certificate.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
