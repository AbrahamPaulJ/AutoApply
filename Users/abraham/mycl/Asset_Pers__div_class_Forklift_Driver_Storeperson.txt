Hiring Manager
[Company Name]

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Storeperson position, as advertised. Having experience in stores/warehouse environments with duties including receiving, dispatching, and inventory management, I am confident I can make a significant contribution to your team. My previous roles have equipped me with the skills to pick and pack orders efficiently, load and unload goods safely, and maintain accurate inventory records.

I am a quick learner with strong organisational and time management skills and pay attention to detail. My experience has instilled in me the importance of general housekeeping duties and I am comfortable with the manual handling of goods. Additionally, I am enthusiastic and capable of working both autonomously and as a team player. My communication skills are excellent and I am available to start immediately. I also possess a current LF forklift driver's licence and have experience operating reach trucks.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
