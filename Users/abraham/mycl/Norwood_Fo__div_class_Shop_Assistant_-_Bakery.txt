Hiring Manager
Foodland

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Bakers Assistant position at Foodland, as advertised on Seek. My previous experience in kitchen environments and my proven ability to work effectively in food preparation roles makes me a strong candidate for this role.

I understand the Bakers Assistant role involves dough production, using machinery and ovens, and requires physical fitness to move and lift products. In my role as Kitchen Hand, I gained experience in food preparation, which included physically demanding tasks and adhering to strict hygiene standards. I am confident in my ability to quickly learn the specific skills required for the bakery environment and contribute to the team's success. My experience working early morning shifts also aligns with the requirement for 5am starts.

My resume also demonstrates my strong numeracy and literacy skills, as well as my ability to communicate effectively with others. I am well-groomed and eager to contribute to a positive and efficient work environment.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
