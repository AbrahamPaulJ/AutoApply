Hiring Manager
Western Hospital

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Receptionist position at Western Hospital, as advertised on Seek. With my customer service experience and administrative skills, I am confident I can provide exceptional support to your patients and visitors, ensuring a welcoming and efficient environment.

In my previous role as a Sales Associate, I assisted customers with inquiries, handled transactions, and maintained a tidy and organized workspace. This experience has honed my communication and problem-solving abilities, enabling me to address customer needs effectively and efficiently. I also have experience providing administrative support, including data entry, and managing phone calls. I am proficient in Microsoft Office Suite, which I believe is a crucial skill mentioned in the job description.

I am a quick learner, highly adaptable, and thrive in dynamic environments. I am particularly drawn to Western Hospital's commitment to providing exceptional patient care and fostering a supportive work environment. I am available to work both morning and afternoon shifts, 3-4 days a week, as required. I am also willing to obtain a National Police Clearance and Working With Children Check.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
