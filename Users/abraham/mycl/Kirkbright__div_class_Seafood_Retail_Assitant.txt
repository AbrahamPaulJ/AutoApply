Hiring Manager
Kirkbright Seafood Co Pty Ltd

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Seafood Retail Assistant position at Kirkbright Seafood Co, as advertised on Seek. Having followed Kirkbright Seafood Co's commitment to providing fresh, sustainable seafood to the Adelaide community for some time, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

With 6 months of experience as a Sales Associate, I have developed strong customer service and point-of-sale skills. I am adept at assisting customers, providing product recommendations, and ensuring a positive shopping experience. My experience in restocking shelves, conducting stock counts, and receiving deliveries has instilled in me a strong attention to detail and a commitment to maintaining a well-organised and fully stocked retail environment. Furthermore, my experience in a kitchen environment has given me a basic understanding of food preparation and hygiene standards.

I am a quick learner, highly adaptable, and thrive in fast-paced environments. I am confident in my ability to handle and prepare fresh seafood products in accordance with food safety standards, as well as maintain the cleanliness and organisation of the retail space. I am also available to work Saturdays.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
