Hiring Manager
Antico forno'

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the front of house team member position at Antico forno' in Marryatville, as advertised on Seek. Having worked as waitstaff previously, I am confident I possess the skills and enthusiasm to contribute to your vibrant restaurant and provide exceptional customer service.

In my previous role as a Kitchen Hand & Waitstaff, I gained experience in taking and serving food and drink orders, answering menu questions, and ensuring a positive dining experience for guests. I also understand the importance of maintaining a clean and organised dining area, a skill I honed through assisting with table setup, clearing, and general cleaning duties. My experience as a Sales Associate also instilled strong communication skills, attention to detail, and the ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment â€“ all of which I believe are essential for success in this role.

I am a quick learner, adaptable, and committed to maintaining high standards. I am also available to work casual shifts, including evenings and weekends. My Responsible Service of Alcohol (RSA) and "Do Food Safely" certifications demonstrate my commitment to safe and responsible hospitality practices.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
