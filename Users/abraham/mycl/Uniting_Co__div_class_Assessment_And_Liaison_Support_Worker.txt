Hiring Manager
Homelessness Connect

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Casual/Part-time Support Service role at Homelessness Connect, as advertised. Having followed Uniting Communities' work for some time, I am deeply impressed by your commitment to reducing inequality and supporting vulnerable individuals, and I am eager to contribute to your mission.

My experience in customer-facing roles, coupled with my adaptable nature, aligns well with the requirements of this dynamic role. I have experience in assisting individuals, actively listening to their needs, and working under pressure, skills I believe are crucial for providing effective telephone-based support. I am confident in my ability to provide a trauma-informed intake and assessment of clients' situations. I am also adept at navigating resources and providing assistance to those in need.

I am available to work a variety of shifts, including mornings, afternoons, overnights, and weekends, and am comfortable working within a 24/7 operation. My skills in data entry, computer literacy, and time management will ensure I can efficiently manage client information and referrals.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
