Hiring Manager
North Eastern Community Hospital

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Administration role at North Eastern Community Hospital (NECH), as advertised on Seek. Having worked in customer-facing roles previously, I am confident in my ability to provide excellent customer service and thrive in a busy environment.

The job description highlighted the need for someone who can work both independently and as part of a team, which aligns perfectly with my work ethic. I am accustomed to prioritizing tasks and working effectively under pressure. My experience includes managing busy phones, handling administrative tasks, and providing support to colleagues. I also possess strong Microsoft Office skills.

I am particularly drawn to NECH's commitment to the community and the opportunity to contribute to a not-for-profit organization that reinvests its profits back into healthcare services. I am available to work a 6-day roster, Monday to Saturday, and hold valid Police and Working With Children Checks, as well as proof of COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
