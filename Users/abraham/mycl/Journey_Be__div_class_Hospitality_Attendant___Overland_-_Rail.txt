Hiring Manager
Journey Beyond Rail Expeditions

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Hospitality Attendant position at Journey Beyond Rail Expeditions, as advertised on Seek. Having followed Journey Beyond's dedication to providing unique and iconic Australian experiences, I am excited by the prospect of contributing to your team.

The roleâ€™s emphasis on guest interaction and providing excellent service strongly aligns with my skills and experience. My time working as waitstaff and a sales associate has equipped me with the ability to engage with customers, promptly address their needs, and create positive experiences. I enjoy interacting with people and thrive in dynamic environments. Moreover, my experience in cleaning and maintaining a high standard of cleanliness as a Room Attendant will ensure a comfortable and enjoyable environment for guests on board.

I possess a valid RSA and a current First Aid certificate, and I am eager to utilise my guest service and hospitality skills to enhance the Journey Beyond experience. I am a highly adaptable and enthusiastic individual, and I am confident in my ability to work effectively as part of your energetic team of hospitality professionals. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to work overnight twice weekly, and I am prepared for the physical demands of the role.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
