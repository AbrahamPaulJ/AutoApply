Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the casual face-to-face interviewer position for the National Drug Strategy Household Survey in Greater Adelaide and Regional SA, as advertised. The opportunity to contribute to such an important national research project, focused on informing policy and improving community wellbeing, strongly resonates with my values.

My experience in roles requiring direct interaction with the public, as a Room Attendant and Sales Associate has equipped me with excellent communication and interpersonal skills. I am comfortable engaging with individuals from diverse backgrounds, explaining complex information clearly, and addressing any concerns they may have. I am dedicated to maintaining a professional and respectful demeanor at all times.

I understand the importance of accuracy and attention to detail in data collection, and I am committed to ensuring that all information gathered is complete and reliable. I am also highly organised, reliable, and available to work full days on Saturdays and Sundays, commencing in late July and continuing through December. I possess a valid driverâ€™s license, access to a reliable vehicle, and a mobile phone, fulfilling all the stated requirements. Moreover, I am comfortable using smart devices such as tablets.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
