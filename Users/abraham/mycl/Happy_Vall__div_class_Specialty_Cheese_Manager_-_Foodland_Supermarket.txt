Hiring Manager
Happy Valley Foodland

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Service Deli role at Happy Valley Foodland, as advertised on Seek. With my retail experience, a strong focus on customer service and ability to work in a fast-paced environment, I am confident I can contribute positively to your team and particularly the successful cheese bar.

My experience as a Sales Associate involved assisting customers, providing recommendations, and ensuring shelves were well-stocked. This experience has equipped me with excellent communication and merchandising skills, which I believe are essential for this role. Furthermore, I have experience with stock control, tracking sales, and inventory data, which are all relevant to the key responsibilities outlined in the job description. I am highly motivated, organised, and eager to learn more about cheese and high-quality food products. I am also available to work Saturdays on a rotational basis.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
