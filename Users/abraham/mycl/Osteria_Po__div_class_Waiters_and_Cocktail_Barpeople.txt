Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the waiter position at Osteria Polpo, as advertised on Seek. With Osteria Polpo's emphasis on Northern Italian cuisine and its picturesque location, I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to your team, especially with the planned Sunday brunch service.

My previous experience as waitstaff has equipped me with the skills necessary to excel in this role. I have a proven ability to promptly serve guests their food and drink orders, answer questions about the menu, and provide recommendations. I am also experienced in setting up and clearing tables, ensuring a clean and welcoming environment for diners.

I am a highly motivated individual with a genuine passion for the hospitality industry. I am confident in my ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment and work effectively as part of a team. Furthermore, I hold a Responsible Service of Alcohol (RSA) certificate and a Do Food Safely certificate, demonstrating my commitment to responsible and safe food handling practices. I am available to work weeknights, primarily Friday and Saturday nights, and Sunday brunch as required.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,
