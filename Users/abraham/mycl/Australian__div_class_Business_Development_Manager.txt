Hiring Manager
ACC

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Business Development Manager position at ACC, as advertised on Seek. With my experience in customer service and cleaning, I am confident I can contribute to your team. In a previous role as a Room Attendant, I maintained high standards of cleanliness while working at a fast pace. This experience has provided me with a strong understanding of the importance of maintaining a clean and hygienic environment.

My experience as a Sales Associate has also equipped me with excellent communication and negotiation skills, which I believe are essential for building strong relationships with potential clients and closing new contracts. I am confident in my ability to identify and pursue new business opportunities and effectively communicate the value proposition of ACC's cleaning services.

I am adaptable, able to work independently, and possess excellent verbal and written communication skills. I am eager to learn more about the commercial cleaning industry and contribute to the growth of ACC.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview. I am available to contact on 0489209259 or abrahampauljaison2@gmail.com

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
