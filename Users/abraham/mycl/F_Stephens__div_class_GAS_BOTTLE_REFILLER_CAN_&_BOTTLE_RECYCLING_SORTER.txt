Hiring Manager
F Stephens & Son P/L

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Gas Bottle Refiller/Cans & Bottles Recycling Sorter & General Hand position at F Stephens & Son P/L, as advertised on Seek. Having read the job description, I am confident that my skills and experience align well with the requirements of this role.

My previous experience as a Sales Associate has equipped me with strong customer service and communication skills, which I believe are essential for interacting with customers and assisting with their enquiries in your retail environment. I am enthusiastic about delivering outstanding service and creating a positive experience for every customer.

Furthermore, my experience in roles requiring physical tasks has prepared me for the manual handling aspects of the position, including refilling gas bottles and sorting cans and bottles. I am physically fit, reliable, and possess a strong work ethic. I'm also comfortable working both independently and as part of a team.

I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to contribute to a small, family-based business and am eager to learn and grow within your team. I am available to work the required hours, including Saturday mornings, and am flexible to cover absences at short notice. I also possess a current driver's license, and I'm willing to undergo a police check and pre-employment medical assessment.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
