Hiring Manager
Green Leaves Early Learning West Lakes

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Kitchen Assistant position at Green Leaves Early Learning West Lakes, as advertised on Seek. Having experience in both kitchen and service roles, coupled with my passion for creating a positive and nurturing environment, I am confident I can significantly contribute to your team.

The opportunity to excite children with nutritious and appealing food aligns perfectly with my experience in assisting with food preparation, including chopping vegetables and preparing simple meals. My time spent as a Kitchen Hand & Waitstaff has provided me with experience in ensuring food safety through washing dishes, utensils, and kitchen equipment, aligning with the requirement to maintain a clean and safe kitchen. Furthermore, I am comfortable greeting families with a friendly smile and providing excellent service, demonstrated through my experience in serving food and drink orders promptly and answering questions about the menu. I'm also eager to learn barista skills to contribute to the welcoming atmosphere.

I am available to work 20 hours per week and willing to step up into the Chef's role when required. I hold current certifications in Food Safety, Working with Children's Check, Child Protection Training, and Anaphylaxis, Asthma, CPR and First Aid.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
