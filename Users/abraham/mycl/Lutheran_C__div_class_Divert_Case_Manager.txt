Georgina Leader
Lutheran Care

Dear Georgina,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Toward Home Divert Case Manager position at Lutheran Care, as advertised. Having followed Lutheran Care's work in the community for some time, I am deeply impressed by your commitment to breaking down barriers and fostering genuine inclusion, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to this mission.

My experience in roles requiring a client-centered approach, assessment and referral skills, and a strong understanding of the challenges faced by vulnerable individuals aligns perfectly with the requirements of this role. I am adept at providing support, advice, and advocacy to clients, and I am committed to empowering them to address presenting issues and achieve secure housing. I understand the importance of accurate and confidential record-keeping within data systems and am meticulous in my approach to documentation.

I hold a Certificate IV in Human Services, and my background has provided me with demonstrated skills in person-centered case management within a trauma-informed practice. I am also keenly aware of the impact of past government policies on First Nations people and am committed to culturally sensitive and respectful practice.

I am confident that my skills and passion for making a tangible difference in the lives of others make me a strong candidate for this position.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
