Hiring Manager
Torrens Parade Ground

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Front of House team member position at Torrens Parade Ground, as advertised on Seek. Having worked as Kitchen Hand & Waitstaff previously, where I served guests and assisted with event set-up, I am confident in my ability to welcome and direct guests, serve food and beverages with professionalism, and ensure the venue is clean and ready for events. My experience as a Room Attendant also honed my skills in maintaining cleanliness to a high standard, a skill I understand is crucial for this role.

I am a confident and well-presented individual with a strong focus on guest satisfaction. I am available to work flexible hours, including nights and weekends, and possess excellent communication and teamwork skills. I am eager to contribute to the dynamic events team at Torrens Parade Ground and deliver outstanding service.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
