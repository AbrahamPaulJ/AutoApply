Hiring Manager
Niña Restaurant

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the casual chef position at Niña Restaurant, as advertised on Seek. Having followed Niña's commitment to bold flavours and South Australian produce, I am particularly excited by the opportunity to contribute to a kitchen that values seasonality and contemporary Spanish cuisine.

My previous experience includes working in a kitchen environment where I assisted in food preparation, plating dishes and preparing simple meals. I'm comfortable working efficiently under pressure, paying close attention to detail, and I possess a genuine passion for food. Furthermore, my role as kitchen hand and waitstaff instilled in me the importance of teamwork and clear communication, skills I believe are essential in a busy kitchen setting. I am available for nights and weekend shifts as required and possess a Responsible Service of Alcohol certification as well as a Do Food Safely certificate.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
