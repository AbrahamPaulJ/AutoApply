Hiring Manager
Thirteen Commercial Cleaning

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Commercial Cleaner position at Thirteen Commercial Cleaning, specialising in construction site amenities, as advertised on Seek. Having worked as a Room Attendant, I have experience performing general cleaning duties including vacuuming, sweeping, mopping, and replenishing supplies. I consistently maintained high standards of cleanliness, even while working at a fast pace.

I am a reliable and motivated individual with a strong work ethic and attention to detail. I am confident in my ability to maintain cleanliness and hygiene to the highest standards within construction site offices, sheds, lunchrooms, and toilet facilities. I am also comfortable working Monday to Friday, with occasional Saturdays, as required.

I possess a valid White Card (Construction Induction), Australian Working Rights, a current Police Clearance, and reliable transport. I am also fluent in English and able to follow instructions and communicate clearly.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
