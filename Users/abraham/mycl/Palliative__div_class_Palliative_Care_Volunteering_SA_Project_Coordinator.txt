Hiring Manager
Palliative Care South Australia

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Palliative Care SA Volunteering Project Coordinator position, as advertised. Having carefully reviewed the requirements, I am confident that my experience in volunteer coordination, project management, and stakeholder engagement aligns well with the needs of your organisation.

In my previous roles, I have gained practical experience in coordinating volunteers and supporting organisations within the community sector. This includes volunteer onboarding and training. I have also been responsible for creating and maintaining databases and regularly preparing reports for stakeholders. I understand the importance of accurate record-keeping, clear communication, and maintaining confidentiality. My proficiency with Office365, coupled with my demonstrated ability to learn new software quickly (including CRM systems), would allow me to seamlessly transition into this role.

I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to contribute to Palliative Care South Australia's mission and vision. My strong customer service and interpersonal skills, combined with my passion for supporting volunteers, make me confident in my ability to effectively coordinate networks, facilitate special interest groups, and respond to volunteer inquiries.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
