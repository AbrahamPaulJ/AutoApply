Hiring Manager

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Pick Packer position, as advertised. Having previous experience involving physical work and maintaining high standards in a fast-paced environment, I am confident I possess the reliability and physical fitness required to excel in this role.

In my previous role as a Room Attendant, I consistently worked at a fast pace while maintaining high standards of cleanliness, demonstrating my ability to meet expectations under pressure. Furthermore, my experience as a Sales Associate involved consistently restocking shelves and managing stock which aligns with the picking and packing aspects of this role. I am a quick learner, adaptable, and comfortable working in team settings, which I believe would make me a valuable asset to your team. I am available to work weekends on a rotating roster.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
