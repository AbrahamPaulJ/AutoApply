I am writing to express my keen interest in the Manager's Relief position at Adelaide Paringa Motel, as advertised on Seek. With my experience in customer service and hospitality, I am confident I possess the skills and dedication to excel in this role and ensure the smooth operation of your motel.

My experience as a Room Attendant has instilled in me a meticulous approach to cleanliness and attention to detail, ensuring a positive guest experience. In addition, my time working in customer-facing roles, like my experience as a Sales Associate, has equipped me with the ability to build rapport easily, handle customer requests efficiently, and resolve complaints in a professional and timely manner. My RSA certification will allow me to fulfill guest requests.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity because I am passionate about providing exceptional customer service and creating memorable experiences for guests. I am eager to learn more about the motel's operations and contribute to its success. I am available to work the required shifts of 9am - 8pm and am flexible with days of work.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
