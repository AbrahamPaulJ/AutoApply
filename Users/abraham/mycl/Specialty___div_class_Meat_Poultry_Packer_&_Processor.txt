Hiring Manager
South Australian Meat Wholesalers/Retailers and Food Service Company

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Chicken/Poultry and Red Meat Packer/Processor position advertised for your South Australian Meat Wholesalers/Retailers and Food Service Company. Having experience in kitchen and food preparation roles, combined with my strong work ethic and ability to work both independently and as part of a team, I am confident I can make a valuable contribution to your operations.

In my previous role as a Kitchen Hand, I gained experience in food preparation tasks such as chopping vegetables, and plating dishes, which developed my knife skills and attention to detail. I am a quick learner and willing to adapt to the specific cutting machine operations, trimming, marinading, and other preparation techniques required for chicken and red meat processing. I also understand the importance of maintaining high standards of cleanliness and hygiene in a food handling environment. My RSA and "Do Food Safely" certifications demonstrate my commitment to these principles.

I am a highly motivated and reliable individual who is available to work early morning shifts from Monday to Friday. I have my own transportation and am not reliant on public transport. I am looking for a long-term, stable employment opportunity and believe my skills and willingness to learn align well with the requirements of this position.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
