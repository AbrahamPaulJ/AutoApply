Hiring Manager
Golding Transport Industries

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Administration/Operations Assistant position at Golding Transport Industries, as advertised. The part-time casual hours of 8-12 per week are an ideal fit with my current study schedule, and I am eager to contribute to your team.

The job description highlights the need for strong organizational skills, attention to detail, and the ability to prioritize and multitask, all of which I possess. My experience as a Junior Bookkeeper provided me with valuable experience in creating invoices, managing bills and maintaining customer records. As a Sales Associate, I developed strong data entry skills through tracking sales and inventory data regularly. I am proficient in MS Excel and am confident in my ability to quickly learn new systems.

Furthermore, my time in previous roles honed my communication and customer service skills, making me comfortable answering and directing phone calls and assisting with reception duties. I am also adept at working autonomously and taking initiative, as required by the role.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
