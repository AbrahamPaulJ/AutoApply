Hiring Manager
[Insert Company Name]

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Casual Barista position at Henley Beach, as advertised on Seek. With my previous experience as kitchen hand and waitstaff where I gained experience assisting in preparing simple meals and serving guests orders promptly as well as my passion for delivering quality products and services, I am confident I can contribute to your team.

I understand the importance of speed and accuracy in a fast-paced environment, and I am eager to learn and further develop my skills as a barista. My RSA and Do Food Safely certifications demonstrate my commitment to maintaining the highest standards of hygiene and responsible service. I am available to work weekdays, weekends, and public holidays on a rotating roster.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
