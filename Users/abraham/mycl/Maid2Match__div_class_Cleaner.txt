Hiring Manager
Maid2Match

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the cleaning position at Maid2Match, as advertised on Seek. The opportunity to contribute to a supportive and team-oriented environment, as highlighted in the job description, particularly resonates with me. My experience as a Room Attendant has equipped me with the skills necessary to excel in this role, including performing general cleaning duties such as vacuuming, sweeping, mopping, linen changes, and thorough cleaning of bathrooms and kitchens.

I am a reliable and friendly individual with a strong work ethic, and I am confident in my ability to quickly adapt to your team's standards and procedures. My availability aligns with the requirement of 3 or more days between Monday to Friday. I am eager to learn and grow as a professional cleaner, and I am particularly drawn to Maid2Match's commitment to providing paid on-the-job training for those without prior experience.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
