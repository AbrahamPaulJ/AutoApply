Hiring Manager
Enliven Community

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Choice Collective Facilitator position at Enliven Community, as advertised on Seek. Having carefully reviewed the job description, I am particularly drawn to Enliven Community's commitment to empowering people with disabilities and fostering choice and control in their support services.

My experience in roles requiring strong interpersonal and communication skills, coupled with my commitment to providing exceptional service, aligns well with the requirements of this position. I have consistently demonstrated the ability to build positive relationships with individuals from diverse backgrounds and with varying communication needs. I am adept at active listening, ensuring that all voices are heard and understood, and adapting my communication style to meet individual preferences.

My previous experience includes facilitating interactions, advocating for individual needs, and working collaboratively to achieve positive outcomes. I am confident in my ability to facilitate Collective meetings, ensuring all attendees are comfortable, engaged, and empowered to express their needs and preferences. I am also proficient in managing administrative tasks and logistical responsibilities associated with meeting planning and follow-up.

Furthermore, I possess a current driver's license and reliable transport, and I am eligible to pass the NDIS worker screening. I am also willing to obtain a First Aid Certificate. My values align strongly with those of Enliven Community, particularly person-centeredness, collaboration, adaptability, resilience, autonomy, initiative, and inclusion.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
