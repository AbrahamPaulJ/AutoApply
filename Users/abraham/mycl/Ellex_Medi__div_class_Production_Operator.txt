Hiring Manager
Ellex Medical

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the assembly and alignment position at Ellex Medical, as advertised on Seek. Having read the job description, I am confident that my skills and experience align well with the requirements of this role.

I possess a highly trained eye for detail and enjoy working with small parts. As a Test Engineer, I was responsible for test automation of software, which required a meticulous approach and a commitment to accuracy. Furthermore, my experience working in teams has equipped me with the ability to collaborate effectively and contribute to a professional work environment. I am also able to read work instructions and understand drawings as required in the job.

I am a highly motivated and dedicated individual who takes pride in ensuring tasks are completed correctly the first time. I am also eager to learn and grow, and I am particularly drawn to Ellex Medical's encouragement of cross-training.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
