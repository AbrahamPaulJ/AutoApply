Hiring Manager
[Company Name]

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Warehouse team member position at your Northern suburbs distribution center, as advertised. The opportunity to join a physically engaging role with flexible shifts and the potential for career progression particularly appeals to me.

Having worked as a Room Attendant, I have experience performing cleaning duties including vacuuming, sweeping and mopping as well as replenishing supplies while working at fast pace and maintaining high standards of cleanliness. My previous role as a Kitchen Hand involved physically demanding tasks, preparing food, serving guests and clearing tables. These experiences have equipped me with the physical stamina and the ability to handle repetitive tasks efficiently, which I understand is crucial for this role. I am also reliable and punctual, with a proven work history demonstrating my commitment to showing up and getting the job done.

I am a quick learner with a positive, can-do attitude and a readiness to learn the Voice Picking System and other tasks involved in the role. I am also comfortable working in a fast-paced environment and meeting KPIs for speed and accuracy. I am confident that I can quickly become a valuable member of your team, ensuring orders are picked, packed, and ready to go accurately and efficiently.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
