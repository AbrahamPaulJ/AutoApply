Furthermore, my experience as a Junior Bookkeeper has given me a strong understanding of office procedures, the preparation of invoices, and a strong attention to detail.

I am proficient in Microsoft Office Suite, including Word, and am capable of preparing professional correspondence, reports, and presentations. I am also a quick learner and eager to expand my knowledge and skills within the professional services environment that Nexia Edwards Marshall offers. My resume highlights my ability to prioritize workloads, maintain a positive attitude, and work effectively both independently and within a team.
