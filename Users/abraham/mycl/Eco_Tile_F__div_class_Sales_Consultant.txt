Hiring Manager
Eco Tile Factory

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Sales Consultant position at Eco Tile Factory, as advertised on Seek. Having followed Eco Tile Factory's work within the Adelaide Restoration Centre and admiring your diverse range of tiles, I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to your team.

My six months of experience as a Sales Associate in a retail environment has equipped me with valuable skills in customer service, product knowledge, and sales techniques. I am adept at assisting customers with their inquiries, providing recommendations, and ensuring a professional and friendly sales process. I am confident in my ability to provide design assistance, product selection, and quotations to your clientele.

Furthermore, I have a strong work ethic and am comfortable working both independently and as part of a small team. I am also physically fit and capable of handling the lifting and manual handling aspects of the role. I am available to work on Mondays, Tuesdays, and alternate Saturdays as required, and I am interested in a long-term position.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
