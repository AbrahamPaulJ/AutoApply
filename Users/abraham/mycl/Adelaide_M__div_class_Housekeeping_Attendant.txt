Lauren Milka
Housekeeping Manager
Comfort Hotel Adelaide Meridien

Dear Ms. Milka,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Housekeeping Room Attendant position at the Comfort Hotel Adelaide Meridien, as advertised on Seek. Having worked as a Room Attendant previously, I am confident in my ability to provide a consistent and high-quality standard of service, ensuring guest rooms are presented to the highest standard.

In my previous role, I was responsible for servicing and cleaning guest rooms, changing linen, replenishing supplies, and ensuring a high standard of cleanliness was consistently maintained. I am also experienced in handling guest queries and complying with guest privacy and security procedures. I am a hard-working and enthusiastic individual and am eager to contribute to your professional housekeeping team. My availability across a 7-day roster, including weekends and public holidays, aligns well with the requirements of this casual role.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
