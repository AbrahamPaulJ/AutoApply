Dear Principal,

I am writing to express my interest in the Administration Assistant position at Kildare College, as advertised on SEEK. Having experience in customer service, handling enquiries, and performing administrative tasks in a fast-paced environment, I am confident I possess the skills and qualities necessary to excel in this role and contribute positively to the Kildare College community.

My previous role as a Sales Associate involved assisting customers, managing transactions, and maintaining organised records. These experiences have equipped me with strong communication and interpersonal skills, as well as the ability to handle a variety of tasks efficiently and accurately. I am adept at managing the flow of people and information, and I am committed to providing excellent customer service to all stakeholders.

I am motivated to apply for this position because I am drawn to Kildare College's commitment to providing a caring and nurturing environment. I am eager to contribute to a supportive and collaborative team where staff engagement and wellbeing are prioritised. I believe my positive attitude, strong work ethic, and ability to learn quickly make me a valuable asset to your team.

I am excited about the opportunity to support the day-to-day operations of the front office and to contribute to the smooth functioning of the College. I am available to work the specified hours of 11:30am - 5:30pm, Monday to Friday, and am committed to upholding the highest standards of professionalism and integrity.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume, the Kildare College Employment Application and Declaration Form, and copies of my certifications for your review. I welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
