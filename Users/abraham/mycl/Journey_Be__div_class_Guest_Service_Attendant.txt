Hiring Manager
Journey Beyond

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Guest Service position at Journey Beyond, as advertised. Having followed Journey Beyond's commitment to providing unique and iconic Australian experiences, I am eager to contribute my skills and passion for creating memorable guest impressions to your team.

My experience in front-of-house hospitality roles has equipped me with the skills necessary to excel in this position. In my previous role as a Sales Associate, I consistently provided excellent customer service, assisting guests with inquiries and ensuring a positive experience. Similarly, my experience as Kitchen Hand & Waitstaff, I honed my abilities in food and beverage service, guest interaction, and maintaining a clean and welcoming environment, all of which I believe directly aligns with the responsibilities outlined in the job description.

I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to create memorable first and last impressions for guests. I possess excellent interpersonal skills and a genuine desire to go above and beyond to ensure guest satisfaction. Furthermore, I understand the importance of flexibility in working hours, including weekends and public holidays, and am fully available to meet the demands of the role. I also hold a current Responsible Service of Alcohol certificate, further demonstrating my readiness to contribute effectively to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
