Hiring Manager
Campbelltown Family Medical Centre

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Medical Receptionist/Administration position at Campbelltown Family Medical Centre, as advertised on Seek. Having read your mission statement of providing ‘care beyond expectation,’ I am particularly drawn to your patient-centred approach and believe my customer service experience aligns well with your values.

In my previous role as a Sales Associate, I consistently provided exceptional customer service, assisting customers with their inquiries and ensuring a positive and helpful experience. I am adept at creating a welcoming and supportive environment for individuals and possess strong organisational skills, which I honed through managing stock levels and assisting with deliveries. I am confident I can effectively manage appointments, patient records, and assist with billing processes as mentioned in the job description. My experience also includes answering phone inquiries, where I always strived to provide clear and helpful information, essential for building relationships with referrers and patients alike. I am eager to contribute to a clinic where quality care and professionalism are paramount.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
