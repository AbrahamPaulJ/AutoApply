Kerin Haywood (Office Manager)
Adelaide Eye

Dear Ms. Haywood,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Medical Receptionist position advertised on Seek. Having read the job description, I am confident that my skills and experience align well with the requirements of this role within your busy practice.

I understand the importance of providing a warm, friendly and professional experience for patients. In my previous role as a Sales Associate, I honed my customer service skills by assisting customers with their inquiries, resolving issues, and ensuring their overall satisfaction. I am adept at building rapport quickly and maintaining a positive attitude, even in a fast-paced environment.

Furthermore, my experience as a Junior Bookkeeper has equipped me with essential skills in invoicing, receipting, and managing financial records. I am proficient in data entry, possess excellent computer skills, and am comfortable using various software programs to efficiently process information. I am also familiar with handling phone calls and general office duties from my experience.

I am particularly drawn to this position because of the opportunity to contribute to a positive team environment within a modern clinic. I am a quick learner, highly adaptable, and eager to expand my knowledge of medical and ophthalmic terminology. I am also available to work the required hours, including early starts and late finishes.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
