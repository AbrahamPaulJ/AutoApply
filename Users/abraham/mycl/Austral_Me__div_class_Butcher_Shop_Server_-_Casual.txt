Hiring Manager
Austral Meat

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the server position at Austral Meat, as advertised on Seek. With my friendly personality, customer service experience and availability across the week, I am confident I can contribute positively to your team.

My experience as a Sales Associate involved assisting customers, providing product recommendations and operating a cash register, skills that align perfectly with the requirements of this role. I understand the importance of product presentation and believe my attention to detail will ensure customers receive the best possible service. I also have experience as Kitchen Hand and Waitstaff, which helps me understand food preparation and customer needs in a fast-paced environment. I am a quick learner, highly adaptable, and comfortable working in a team. I also possess a Responsible Service of Alcohol (RSA) certificate.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity because it offers the chance to directly interact with customers in a retail environment, something I genuinely enjoy. I am motivated, positive and take pride in providing excellent service. My summary as a master's student in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at The University of Adelaide makes me a quick learner and allows me to effectively balance my studies with work. The advertised shifts on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday align perfectly with my current availability, and I'm also available during Uni/School holidays.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
