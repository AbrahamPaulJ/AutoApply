Hiring Manager
Magill Primary School

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the School Canteen Assistant position at Magill Primary School, as advertised on Seek. My experience in food preparation, customer service, and maintaining high standards of cleanliness and hygiene aligns well with the requirements of this role.

In my previous role as Kitchen Hand & Waitstaff, I gained practical experience in food preparation, plating dishes, and providing prompt and friendly service to customers. I am comfortable working in a fast-paced environment and understand the importance of teamwork and effective communication. My experience as a Room Attendant demonstrates my ability to maintain cleanliness and hygiene to a high standard. I understand food safety standards.

I am a quick learner, reliable, and punctual, and I am confident in my ability to contribute to the smooth running and operation of the canteen. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to work with children and prepare and serve freshly prepared food, and possess excellent Eftpos and cash handling skills. I also hold a current "Do Food Safely" certificate. I also have a valid Working with Children Check.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume, cover letter and WWCC certificate for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
