Hiring Manager
X-Golf/Hey Caddy

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the available casual role at X-Golf/Hey Caddy in Marion, as advertised on Seek. Having read that no prior golf expertise is needed and that you are looking for individuals with excellent people skills available on Fridays and Saturdays, I am confident I possess the qualities you seek. My availability aligns perfectly with the requirements of this role.

My previous experience as a Sales Associate involved assisting customers, providing recommendations, and ensuring a positive shopping experience. I believe these skills translate directly to creating a welcoming and enjoyable atmosphere for guests at X-Golf/Hey Caddy. Furthermore, my experience as Kitchen Hand & Waitstaff provided me with valuable food and beverage skills. I am also familiar with event and function support.

I am a team player with a strong work ethic and a customer-focused approach. My RSA Certificate and enthusiasm for learning new things will allow me to quickly integrate into your team and contribute to the success of X-Golf/Hey Caddy.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
