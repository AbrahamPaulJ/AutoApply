Hiring Manager
4WD Supacentre, Kilburn

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Casual Sales Representative position at the 4WD Supacentre Kilburn location, as advertised. Having followed Adventure Kings for some time, I am impressed by the company's commitment to providing affordable and reliable gear to the Australian outdoor community, and I am eager to contribute to its continued success.

With six months of experience in retail sales, I have developed a strong customer-first approach and a proven track record of achieving sales goals. In my previous role, I consistently assisted customers with their inquiries, provided product recommendations, and operated the cash register efficiently. I am confident in my ability to quickly learn your extensive product range and provide exceptional service to every customer who walks through the door. I am a team player with a positive attitude, and I am excited by the opportunity to join a high-performing crew and help shape the success of the new Kilburn store. The chance to embrace the outdoor lifestyle and share my passion with fellow adventurers is a particularly appealing aspect of this role.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
