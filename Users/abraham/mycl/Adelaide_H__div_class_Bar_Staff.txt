Hiring Manager
Adelaide Hockey Club

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the 'front of house' host position at Adelaide Hockey Club, as advertised. Having worked in roles involving customer service and stock management, I am confident I possess the skills and dedication necessary to excel in this role and contribute positively to the club.

My experience as waitstaff has equipped me with strong bar service skills, including taking orders, preparing drinks, and ensuring customer satisfaction. Furthermore, my previous role in retail involved regular stock counts and inventory management, highlighting my ability to maintain accurate stock levels and ensure efficient bar operations.

I understand the importance of responsible alcohol service and hold a current RSA certification. I am a reliable and dedicated individual with excellent communication skills, and I am comfortable working independently and as part of a team. The advertised shift times suit my current schedule, and I am eager to embrace the responsibilities of this role.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
