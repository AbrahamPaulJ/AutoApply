Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Shop Assistant position at The Bakery On O'Connell, as advertised on Seek. With my experience in customer service, food preparation, and maintaining a clean and organised environment, I am confident I can quickly become a valuable member of your team.

My experience as a Kitchen Hand & Waitstaff has equipped me with valuable skills in food preparation, hygiene practices, and working effectively in a fast-paced setting. I am also adept at multitasking, thinking on my feet, and taking initiative to ensure customer satisfaction and a smoothly run service.

I am eager to learn and adapt to the specific needs of The Bakery On O'Connell and am available to work any shift across all days of the week, with a minimum of 25 hours and up to 38 hours. I am particularly comfortable working weekends. My resume details my availability further.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,
