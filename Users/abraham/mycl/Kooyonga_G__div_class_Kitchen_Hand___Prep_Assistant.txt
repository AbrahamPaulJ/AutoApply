Mrs Kylie Christie
Food & Beverage Manager
Kooyonga Golf Club

Dear Mrs. Christie,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Kitchen Hand/Sandwich Artist/Prep Assistant position at Kooyonga Golf Club, as advertised on Seek. Having worked in a kitchen and hospitality environment previously, I am confident I possess the skills and enthusiasm to contribute positively to your team.

My experience includes assisting with food preparation, washing dishes, and maintaining a clean and organized workspace. I have experience chopping vegetables, preparing simple meals, and plating dishes. I understand the importance of food safety and hygiene standards and am committed to following all relevant regulations. Furthermore, I am adept at working in a fast-paced environment and supporting the kitchen team during busy service periods. My experience as a Room Attendant has instilled in me a strong sense of cleanliness and attention to detail, both crucial for this role.

I am a reliable and motivated individual with a strong work ethic. I am available to work a minimum of 3 days per week, including weekends, and am flexible with my availability to meet business needs. My RSA and Do Food Safely certifications demonstrate my commitment to safe practices within the hospitality industry.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
