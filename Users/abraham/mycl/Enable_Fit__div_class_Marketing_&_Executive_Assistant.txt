Zoe
Enable Fitness Centre

Dear Zoe,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Marketing & Executive Assistant position at Enable Fitness Centre, as advertised on Seek. Having followed Enable Fitness Centre's growth and impact within the South Australian community, I am particularly drawn to the organisation's mission of providing inclusive and accessible fitness solutions for individuals with disabilities. My experience in customer service, combined with my technical skills and passion for content creation, make me a strong candidate to contribute to your team.

My previous experience as a Sales Associate has honed my communication and customer service skills, allowing me to confidently engage with a diverse range of people and provide excellent support. I am proficient with social media tools and have experience creating engaging content. Additionally, my familiarity with Google Workspace and Microsoft Office enables me to quickly adapt to new software and efficiently manage administrative tasks. I am particularly excited by the opportunity to leverage my creative eye and attention to detail to contribute to Enable's marketing efforts through managing key contacts, coordinating content using Canva and photo/video editing, and maintaining social media engagement.

I am also highly organised and adept at managing competing priorities, which I believe will be valuable in providing executive support to the CEO. My eagerness to learn and contribute to strategic projects, combined with my strong work ethic, make me confident in my ability to thrive in this dual-role position.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume and portfolio work for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
