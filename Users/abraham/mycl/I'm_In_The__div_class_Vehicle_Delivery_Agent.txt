Matthew Newton (State Manager)
I'm in the Right

Dear Mr. Newton,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Casual Vehicle Delivery Agent position at I'm in the Right, as advertised on Seek. Having a strong interest in cars, excellent customer service skills, and a proven ability to work both independently and as part of a team, I am confident I possess the qualities you are seeking.

In my previous roles, I have consistently demonstrated excellent interpersonal and communication skills while assisting customers with their needs and addressing their queries. I understand the importance of providing a professional and caring experience, and I am adept at collecting and relaying information accurately. My experience in roles requiring a high degree of attention to detail and commitment to quality standards makes me well-suited to the responsibilities of delivering and collecting vehicles while ensuring they are clean and presentable. I also have a valid, unrestricted Australian driver's license.

I am a motivated and enthusiastic individual with a "go-getter" attitude. I am available to work 16-24 hours per week between Monday to Sunday, 7am-7pm, and am eager to learn and contribute to the success of your team. I am particularly drawn to I'm in the Right's mission to assist not-at-fault drivers and am excited about the opportunity to help customers get back on the road as quickly as possible.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
