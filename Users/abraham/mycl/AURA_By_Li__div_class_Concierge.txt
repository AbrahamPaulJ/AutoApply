Hiring Manager
Aura by Livewell Communities

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Concierge position at Aura by Livewell Communities, as advertised on Seek. Having read the job description, I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to contribute to a luxurious and caring community and make a real difference in residentsâ€™ lives. My experience in customer-facing roles, coupled with my commitment to providing exceptional service, aligns perfectly with the requirements of this role.

In my previous role as a Room Attendant, I developed a strong work ethic and attention to detail, maintaining high standards of cleanliness and organisation, which I believe are essential for maintaining common areas as stated in the job description. My experience as a Sales Associate also honed my communication and problem-solving skills, allowing me to provide assistance to customers, manage requests, and handle inquiries effectively. Further, I have a valid driver's license, and am willing to get the First Aid certification.

I am a quick learner, tech-savvy, and eager to learn about Retirement legislation and standards. I am also available to work a variety of shifts, including afternoon/night and day shifts, and I am available all 7 days a week as required.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
