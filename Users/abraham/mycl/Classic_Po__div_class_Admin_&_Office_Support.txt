Hiring Manager
[Company Name]

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the casual office role advertised on Seek. I am particularly drawn to this opportunity because it aligns with my skills and availability, as I am seeking a part-time role to complement my studies.

My experience as a Sales Associate has provided me with valuable skills in customer service, communication, and general office duties. I am proficient with Microsoft Word and Excel, and possess sound computer knowledge. I am also comfortable communicating with customers and suppliers. I have a polite phone manner and am capable of working independently and as part of a team. I am confident in my ability to handle tasks such as answering emails, greeting customers, and performing general office duties, even when covering for Sales Managers.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
