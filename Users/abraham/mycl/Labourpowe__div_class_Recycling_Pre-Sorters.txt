Hiring Manager
LABOURPOWER

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Recycling Pre-Sorter position at LABOURPOWER, as advertised. Having read the job description, I am confident that my skills and experience align well with the requirements of this role.

My previous role as a Room Attendant involved repetitive manual handling tasks and maintaining high standards of cleanliness in a fast-paced environment, demonstrating my physical stamina and attention to detail. I am also accustomed to working under pressure and maintaining efficiency. As a Kitchen Hand, I have experience with cleaning and maintaining a safe work environment.

I am reliable, possess strong communication skills, and am available for both Day and Afternoon shifts. I am also comfortable accepting shifts at short notice. Furthermore, I understand the importance of safety protocols and am willing to undergo drug and alcohol testing and a criminal history check. I have basic computer skills necessary to complete required inductions.

I am eager to contribute to the continuous improvements within the plant and am confident in my ability to learn quickly and work effectively as part of a team.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
