Dear Amy,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Front of House position at Tommy Gun's Marion, as advertised on Seek. Having followed Tommy Gun's growth and reputation for a unique barbershop experience, I am particularly drawn to the fast-paced environment and the focus on providing exceptional customer service.

With 6 months of experience in a retail environment, I have developed strong customer service and sales skills. I am confident in assisting customers, recommending products, and handling transactions efficiently. I am also comfortable working in a fast-paced environment, ensuring customer needs are met while maintaining a positive attitude. My resume also reflects a dedication to teamwork and a willingness to learn, which I believe are essential for contributing to your shop's success. Furthermore, my RSA certification and prior food handling experience equip me to confidently handle beverage service and maintain hygiene standards.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to contribute to a team that values a fun and energetic atmosphere. My customer-focused approach and positive attitude align perfectly with Tommy Gun's commitment to creating a memorable experience for every client. I am also eager to learn about the barbering industry and grow within the company. As a Master's student, I am available to work Thursday nights and Saturdays.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
