Hiring Manager
Windsor Smith

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Retail Casual Sales Assistant position at Windsor Smith in Adelaide Arcade, as advertised on Seek. With my availability to work Monday to Friday, weekends including late nights, and my previous experience in a sales associate role, I am confident I possess the skills and enthusiasm to excel in this role.

In my previous Sales Associate role, I honed my customer service skills by assisting customers with questions and providing product recommendations. I also have experience in restocking shelves, conducting stock counts, and operating a cash register, all skills which are essential for success in a fast-paced retail environment. I am a quick learner, highly adaptable, and thrive in team settings. I am also energetic and vibrant and have a strong customer-first approach, which I believe aligns perfectly with Windsor Smith's brand.

I am eager to contribute to a growing company and believe my passion for customer service and my proven ability to work effectively in a team make me a strong candidate. I am also keen to earn commission based on performance and am motivated by the opportunity for career progression within Windsor Smith. As requested, I can provide two senior referees upon request.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
