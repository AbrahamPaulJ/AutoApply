Kirby Lynch
Lutheran Care

Dear Kirby,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Thrift Shop Sorter role at Lutheran Care, as advertised. Having followed Lutheran Care's work in the community for some time, I am deeply impressed by your commitment to providing affordable clothing and vital support services, and I am eager to contribute to this mission.

My experience in retail, including sorting and restocking shelves, makes me confident in my ability to efficiently and effectively sort donated clothing and accessories to a high standard. I'm a quick learner and possess a keen eye for detail, allowing me to quickly identify items of value and contribute to filling store orders accurately. I am also comfortable working with volunteers and assisting them with product knowledge.

Furthermore, my strong work ethic, reliability, and passion for sustainability align perfectly with the values of Lutheran Care. I believe my customer service skills and ability to work both independently and as part of a team would make me a valuable asset to your Thrift Shop team. I am also physically fit and comfortable with the demands of a role that involves sorting and moving stock.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,

Abraham Paul Jaison
